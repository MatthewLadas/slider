# slider

This project aims to practice what I’ve recently learned in JavaScript. I’ll be adding HTML and CSS starter files as the project’s goal is to focus solely on JS.

I’ll be using this Slider project to re-enforce my knowledge on using Functions including Scope, Hoisting and Closures, The DOM, Destructuring and Events Listeners.
